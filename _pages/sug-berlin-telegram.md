Currently communication happens mostly in Telegram. There are native Telegram 
Clients availablefor Sailfish OS as well as for almost every mobile and desktop operating 
system.

Currently there are two groups (currently most discussions in German):

- [SailfishOS USer Group Berlin](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAAY9irVflCDgpnUD-Q) - discussions related to the monthly meetups in Berlin
- [German SailfishOS Community](https://telegram.me/joinchat/CCMYXQnxqdq5v1lue-5aBQ) - Everything SailfishOS reated

For discussions in English we recommend the following group:

- [Sailfish OS Fan Club](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEE-U9p37fqAsU9Hbg) - very international audience (more than 200 members currently)

In addition there is a Group that is used to share information only:

- [SailfisOS News Network](https://t.me/sailfishosnewsnetwork) - read only
